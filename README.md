# GallStone-Detection
This a Machine Learning project that uses a classifier SVM to predict GallStone, using LOF to detect and eliminate outliers. By the other hand, I used RFE (recursive feature elimination) to increase the accuracy and f1-score talking about presence of Gallstone (the best indicator for medicine predictions).
